# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript


For project 0 I have develop a web page for my company Zuplo, this page will works as an e-commerce mix with IoT for vending machines.

--> zuplo_home.html is the initial page, in this page there is the slogan of the company and two buttons one for  login and one for new users to register, all styling came from style2.scss file.

-->zuplo_login.html is the login page with a form asking for email and password a login button and the zuplo image at top works as button for going back to home page.(currently there is no programming of id verification) by clicking login it takes the user to zuplo_accout.html. All styling came from style2.scss file.

-->zuplo_account.html is a product selection page with 3 options, each with a button, there is also a button on top right for logout; this buttons redirect the user to home page. By choossing any of the options user will be redirect to zuplo_confirmation.html. All styling came from stylebs.scss file. Bootstrap is use for this page.

-->zuplo_confirmation.html is a page with a table with a resume of the product and the price of the product. It has two buttons, one for going back to selection and one for dispensing the product in the vending machine and going back to login page. There is also a button for logout on top right. All styling came from stylebs.scss file. Bootstrap is use for this page.

-->zuplo_register.html contains a form for collecting all information required from the user. by clicking the register button the user will be redirect to the zuplo_account.html. The Zuplo logo acts as a button for going homepage.
