Alright, now it’s time to make your website your own. Design a personal webpage about yourself, one of your interests, or any other topic of your choice. The subject matter, look and feel, and design of the site are entirely up to you, subject to the following requirements:

Your website must contain:
 --> 4 different .html pages
 --> it should be possible to get from any page on your website to any other page by following one or more hyperlinks.
 --> one list (ordered or unordered)
 --> one table
 --> one image.
 --> one stylesheet file.
	->Your stylesheet(s) must use:
		-Five different CSS properties
		-Five different types of CSS selectors
		-Must use the #id selector at least once
		-The .class selector at least once.
		-Must include at least one mobile-responsive @media query, such that something about the styling changes for smaller screens.

 -->use Bootstrap 4 on your website
	->Taking advantage of at least one Bootstrap component
	->using at least two Bootstrap columns for layout purposes using Bootstrap’s grid model.

 --> Stylesheets must use at least one SCSS variable, at least one example of SCSS nesting, and at least one use of SCSS inheritance.

In README.md, include a short writeup describing your project, what’s contained in each file, and (optionally) any other additional information the staff should know about your project.

Note that not all of the above requirements are covered in Lecture 0, some will be introduced in Lecture 1.
